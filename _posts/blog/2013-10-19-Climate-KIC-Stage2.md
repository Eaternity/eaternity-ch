09:30: Anerdgy
 
09.50 Captain Plant

10.50 Organic Standard
 
11.10 ReWinner
 
11.30 SmargeTech



Pro’s:

-       Your will to work on low budget and your high motivation are very impressive!

-       Positive development, the market is difficult and the demand from system gastronomy exists

-       Your data is recognized and used!

 Con’s:

-       Biggest barrier was the past, when you sold yourselves too cheap (the coaching in negotiations sold out)

- 	You need a pilot with a big customer

 

Keep going:

-       Communicate to the end-user: explain the different numbers concerning climate impact of e.g.  a NZ-apple or local apple

-       Spread the idea also to “normal” restaurants, not only in the system gastronomy

-       Move beyond the Swiss market

-       Get a big partner such as Migros! The name matters more than the prize in the first year. 

 

Watch Out!:

-       System gastronomy is all about costs, don’t get pushed down & focus on improving negotiations

-       Choose one path so that this idea has a fast break through
