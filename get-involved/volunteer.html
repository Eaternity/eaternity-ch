						<h6>Fundraising Committees</h6>
						<p>Rebekah Children's Services hosts 3-5 fundraising events throughout the year.

These events are enormously important for Rebekah Children's Services because they provide much needed funding while also educating the community about our services and programs. Currently there are three major event committees that would love to have your membership and creative support. The RCS Bowl-a-thon is usually hosted in April, RCS Casino Night is hosted in the month of August and our Festival of Trees event closes out the year in November.</p>
